# SwedishCovid19Models

We collect data, papers, and models for modeling/prediction in relation to COVID-19. Focus is on epidemiological modeling, typically with a statistical/stochastic flavor. 

Our focus is on Sweden but our aim is generality and modularity so that others can apply to their context.

Our goal is not to point out one, "best" model but to get strength in numbers, i.e. by seeing a number of different models and approaches and their predictions this can, taken together, help inform policy and decisions.

## Models

### Model comparison

TBD, simple table to compare models...

### Models

Internationally:
- [Bayesian CFR (Case Fatality Rate) model](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr) from Riou et al at University of Bern. ([Latest PDF](https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr/blob/master/manuscript/manuscript_v2.pdf))

## Data

We collect raw as well as cleaned (pre-processed, filtered, and curated) data for people that want to build their own models.

### Raw data

### Cleaned Swedish data

[ECDC data](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) for Sweden:
- incidence data, all cases: [all_swedish_cases_incidence_20200328_1036.csv](data/clean/sweden/all_swedish_cases_incidence_20200328_1036.csv)
- incidence data, starting from 3 days before first case: [start_minus3_swedish_cases_incidence_20200328_1036.csv](data/clean/sweden/start_minus3_swedish_cases_incidence_20200328_1036.csv)

[Folkh√§lsomyndigheten](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa):
- age distributed: [age_distributions_cases_and_deaths/20200328_1634.csv](data/raw/Folkhalsomyndigheten/age_distributions_cases_and_deaths/20200328_1634.csv)

## Papers

We collect relevant research papers and pre-prints on modeling in relation to COVID-19 and other, relevant epidemics. [See this file for links to all the papers](papers/Covid19ModelingPapers.md), below we just list the ones for Sweden:

- TBD
