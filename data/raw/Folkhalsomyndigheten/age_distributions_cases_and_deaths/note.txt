In the first two files:
20200328_1000.csv
20200328_1634.csv
the data for 80-89 and 90+ was merged into the row for 80. This is because of the model we was running at the time only considered 80+ and not 90+.

We changed this from 2020-03-29 to really have the raw data here.

From 20200402 we process this data from the FHM excel sheet and thus
have different row names and include info on the number of ICU patients.
